## (IRIS-NP:) [Growing Convex Collision-Free Regions in Configuration Space using Nonlinear Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14737.pdf) - 1/12/2024
### Method
- Assumptions: known collision geometries.
- Goal: generate convex polytope w/max volume inscribed ellipsoid
   - <sub><sup>Note: calculating volume of polytope itself is NP-hard → ellipsoid as a heuristic</sup></sub>.
- Ellipsoid expressed like so: $ \epsilon(C,d) = {x | (x-d)^T C^T C(x-d) \leq 1}) $.
- Polytope expresed as collections of "halfplanes": $ P(A,b) = \{x|Ax \leq b\} $
- Initialization: seed $q_0$; $P_0$ is initialized w/robot joint limits. $\epsilon_0$ initialized as tiny hyperphere.
- Adding Separating Hyperplanes: Iterate over all pairs of collision bodies, searches for configurations within polytope resulting in collision ("counter-example search"). Adds plane tangent to the ellipsoid at any collision point .
   - "counter-example search": Technically, solves (non-linear) optimization for nearest point to ellipsoid center that results in collision between two given collision bodies (if one of the collision bodies is a robot link, need to perform forward kinematics to detect the collision $\rightarrow$ non-linearity). Can be geometrically understood as uniformly expanding ellipsoid until collision detected.
   - if obstacles are convex in config. space (usually not the case unless you pre-decompose non-convex obstacles into convex parts), then tangent hyperplane guaranteed to separate collision from non-collision.
   - if obstacles non-convex in config. space, back the hyperplane away by user-defined margin $\delta$.

      - makes hyperplane extra conservative, but ensures finite number of hyperplanes can guarantee the convex set is out of collision.
   - Repeat until "counter-example search" repeatedly fails (probably no more collisions in convex set; this is not guaranteed bc the "counter-example search" is a non-linear optimization $\rightarrow$ not guaranteed to find all solutions).
- Analytically calculate volume of inscribed ellipse.
- Repeat until ellipse growth rate too low.
   

Questions: why are there 2 layers of repetition? Shouldn't you only need 1?
- repeat counter-example search for each pair of collision bodies
- repeat entire process until ellipse growth rate too low.

### Background
- Traj. Opt. is optimal, but low in high dimensions, many obstacles (many non-convexities)
- Advantages of GCS:
   - takes advantage of sampling & optimization to achieve global optimality quickly in clutter & high dimensions
   - works with differential constraints (i.e. velocity/acceleration) (sampling algorithms have trouble with this due to discreet samples)
